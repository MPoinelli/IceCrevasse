# IceCrevasse

Numerical model to simulate crack growth on brittle ice with a LEFM-based approach.

##
Key executables are included in _routines folder. 

These include vertical propagation at local and global scale and horizontal propagation at local scale only.

##
Supporting functions are included in _support_functions

Supporting parameters and global variables are included in: _physical_parameters 


_target_features includes shape files and raster.
